## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Further revision/work is required on flexbox layouts and look into using CSS Grid instead as it gives greater control over the layout.

### Useful resources

- [devPractical - How to Create a Responsive 3 Column Layout Flexbox CSS](https://devpractical.com/3-columns-flexbox-layout-css/) - I have used flexbox before but was struggling to get the three columns to keep equal widths rather than adjust to the width of the content. This provided the fix.
